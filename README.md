ABOUT THE DATASET

This dataset contains 5 years of simulated delivery data for several customers in several different locations.

The purpose of this dataset is to mimic real-world delivery patters by including seasonality, demand spikes, and holiday closures. 

This dataset is perfect for anyone trying to practice time-series forecasting, demand planning, or supply chain analysis.

 INTRODUCTION

There is something inherently fascinating about supply chain data; it tells the story of orders, deliveries, and business dynamics through time. 
In this notebook I explore a time-series dataset containing supply chain deliveries. I cleaned and preprocess the data, perform an exploratory analysis with a variety of visualizations, 
and even build a simple predictor for Total Revenue.

CONCLUSION 

I have explored the supply chain deliveries dataset by performing data cleaning, a variety of visualizations, and building a simple predictor for `TotalRevenue`. 
The linear regression model provided a baseline understanding of the relationship between order metrics and revenue. 

Merits of our approach:

- Data parsing and cleaning steps ensure that time-series information is accurately preserved.
- Multiple visualization techniques allow a comprehensive view of distributions and relationships in the data.
- The predictor, even though simple, offers insights that can be built upon using more complex models.

Ideas for future work include:

- Incorporating additional features such as categorical encodings or external economic indicators.
- Using time-series forecasting techniques to predict future revenues.
- Experimenting with more advanced machine learning models and cross-validation strategies.
